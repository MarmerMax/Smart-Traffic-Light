# Smart Traffic Light

Final academic project at Ariel University 2020.

The purpose of the system is to reduce the waiting time for drivers at traffic lights. 
This process is possible if you find a profitable traffic distribution and change the work of traffic lights.

This project shows how the graph search algorithm can solve this problem and significantly reduce the waiting time.
